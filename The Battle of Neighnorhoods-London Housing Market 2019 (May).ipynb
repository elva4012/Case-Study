    "Home price in London growth has been gradually slowing ever since the summer of 2016. A moribund market is preventing potential sellers from bringing their homes to the market and an ongoing decline in new instructions being listed for sale has intensified of late. A recent survey of U.K. residential property from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) concluded that Brexit is currently the main obstacle for market activity. And uncertainty over how the U.K. leaves the European Union was holding back both buyers and sellers of property. House prices may be continuing to fall with the number of new inquiries down for the eighth consecutive month, according to an industry survey."
